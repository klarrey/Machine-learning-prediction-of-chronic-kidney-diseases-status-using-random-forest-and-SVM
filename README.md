# Machine-learning-prediction-of-chronic-kidney-diseases-status-using-random-forest-and-SVM
This machine learning project involves the implementation of random forest and SVM models in R to predict whether or not a person has chronic kidney disease.
Dataset used for the project was obtained from the UCI machine learning repository and is provided along with the R script so anybody can follow.
